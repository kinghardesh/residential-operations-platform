# Residential Operations Platform (ROP)

A comprehensive **Database Management System (DBMS)** project designed to streamline residential society management. ROP provides a centralized platform for managing residents, owners, staff, complaints, payments, visitors, and resource tracking — all integrated into a unified database architecture.

## 🎯 Project Overview

ROP is built as a full-stack database management solution that demonstrates practical implementation of relational database concepts, role-based access control, and real-time data operations. The platform serves as a complete operational console for residential complexes, apartment buildings, and gated communities.

## ✨ Features

- 👀 **Visitor Management**: Pre-approved visitors with time logs and audit records
- 💧 **Resource Monitoring**: Water and electricity consumption analytics
- 👨‍🔧 **Staff Management**: Assign and track maintenance staff
- 📊 **Analytics & Reports**: Charts and visualizations for data-driven decisions

### **Technical Highlights**
- Database-driven architecture with normalized tables
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Real-time profile management
- Responsive design for all devices
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
